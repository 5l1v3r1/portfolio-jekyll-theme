<h4>Data Analysis</h4>

<p>Using data gathered from the <a href="http://www.iwf.net/" target="_blank">International Weightlifting Federation's</a> website, I generated a few graphs comparing a number of variables affecting a weightlifter's results at the Olympics. Data analysis was done in Python, with all the plots made using Python's Matplotlib library.</p>
