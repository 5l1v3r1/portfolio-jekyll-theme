  <h1 id="im-a-physics-major-turned-programmer">I’m a physics major turned programmer</h1>

<p>Ever since I first learned how to program while taking a scientific computing for physics course, I have pursued programming as a passion, and as a career. Under Projects, you will find some of my favourite things that I have built over the years. You may find everything else on my <a href="http://github.com/lenpaul">Github</a> and <a href="https://codepen.io/lenpaul">Code Pen</a> profiles, as well as <a href="resume-paul-le.pdf">download a copy of my resume</a>.</p>

<p>I strongly believe that online open education is the future of education, and one organization that I believe is leading this movement for web development is <a href="https://freecodecamp.com">Free Code Camp</a>. Some of my projects are those that I have developed through Free Code Camp’s <a href="https://freecodecamp.com/map">Front End Development curriculum</a>. You may view them all on my <a href="https://codepen.io/lenpaul">Code Pen</a> profile.</p>

<p>At heart, I will always love physics. Something that I did not know going into university was how closely related computer programming and physics are, and how much programming actually goes on in physics. Ever since I first learned how to program through studying physics, I have been hooked, and as a result, some of my favourite projects are those that I have done relating to computational physics, which can again be found on my <a href="http://github.com/lenpaul">Github</a> profile.</p>
